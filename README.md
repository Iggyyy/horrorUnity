# Unity horror 
A horror-like game created with c# in unity. The whole game is based on an idea of collecting notes to get into the next chapter of the story.

## Background story
You wake up in the middle of the night in an old abandoned wodden village. You have only small fleshlight with limmited ammount of baterry. Be careful to not run out of your power because without a light it's difficult to find notes. In order to get out from this place you have to collect all 8 notes and then open a gate.
